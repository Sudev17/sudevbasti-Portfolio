        "medium": "Most existing pothole detection systems are trained on foreign datasets and perform poorly on Indian roads due to shadows, water patches, and irregular textures. To address this, we created a custom Indian dataset using web scraping and data augmentation, capturing realistic conditions like uneven surfaces, patches, and varying lighting. The proposed hybrid model combined YOLOv8 for real-time detection, CNN for spatial feature extraction, and Transformers for contextual awareness. Evaluated against foreign-trained models, our approach achieved 92% accuracy, significantly reducing false positives.
